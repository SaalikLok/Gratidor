# Gratidor
A CLI assistant and gratitude journal to keep you centered during your days of code.

## Using Gratidor
1. Clone this Repository
2. `cd` to this directory
3. Run `ruby gratidor.rb` from the terminal

## Motivation
I wrote this fun CLI application to have a place to store my gratitudes in a fun and easy way from the terminal.

This project is a learning project for Ruby as I dip my toes into the awesome language.
